# Operating and testing the cell

TODO


Turn the pumps on and circulate the electrolytes for 15 min before applying any current. This should allow enough time for the separator to become fully wetted with electrolyte and clear out any bubbles trapped in the cell/felts.

Using a syringe, add 5 mL of electrolyte to each reservoir, weighing the syringe before and after injection to record the actual mass added to each reservoir.
