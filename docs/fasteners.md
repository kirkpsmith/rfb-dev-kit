# M6 Fasteners

Four M6 x 35 mm hex socket cap nuts and bolts (with washers) are used to compress the cell.

For iodide-containing electrolytes, trace triiodide remaining in the cell during disassembly can deteriorate stainless steel, zinc-coated, and mild steel fasteners, which is why titanium is recommended for routine usage.
