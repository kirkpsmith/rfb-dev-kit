## Grafoil sheet

Grafoil sheet is compressed graphite commonly used in industry as high-temperature gasket material. It is affordable and similar enough for our purpose here to bipolar plate material, which is much harder to source.

Note that you cannot find this on AliExpress anymore due to export restrictions or similar.
