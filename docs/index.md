>!! **Warning** 
>!!
>!! If you're starting from scratch, you need to [fabricate](fabrication.md) and source everything needed for using this flow battery test cell.

If you already have all the required components and materials, you can directly [prepare the power electronics](electronics.md), [assemble the cell](cell_assembly.md), [assemble the jig](jig_assembly.md), prepare the [electrolyte](electrolyte.md), and then begin [testing](testing.md).
