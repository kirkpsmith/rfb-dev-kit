# Start here

If you're starting from scratch, you need to [fabricate](fabrication.md) and source everything needed for testing this flow battery test cell.

If you already have all the required components and materials, you can directly [assemble](assembly.md) your cell, prepare the [electrolyte](electrolyte.md), and then begin [testing](testing.md).
