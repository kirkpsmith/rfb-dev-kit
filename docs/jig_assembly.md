# Assembling the jig with electronics and flow cell

Gather the following components:
{{BOM}}

## Add pumps to jig {pagestep}

Insert the two [peristaltic pumps](pumps.md){qty:2} into their holders in the [jig](fromstep){qty: 1} as shown:

## Add reservoirs to jig {pagestep}

Insert the two [reservoirs](fromstep){qty: 2} into the jig as shown:


>!! **Warning** 
>!!
>!! One barb on each reservoir is slightly longer than the other barb. This longer barb is for electrolyte returning to the reservoir from the cell, and there is an internal channel in the reservoir that returns electrolyte to the top of the reservoir.
>!!
>!!The short barb is for electrolyte going to the pumps from the reservoir, and it draws electrolyte from the bottom of the reservoir. 


## Add tubing to jig {pagestep}

Take the six [cut tubing pieces](fromstep){qty: 4,cat: part} and connect the tubing as shown:

## Add cell to jig and connect to tubing {pagestep}

Take the [assembled flow cell](fromstep){qty:1} and place it into the jig, connecting the tubing as shown:

>!! **Warning** 
>!!
>!! Avoid creating kinks and sharp bends in the tubing when assembling the cell. This can create issues with electrolyte flow.

## Add electronics to jig {pagestep}

Place the [motor control electronics](fromstep){qty:1}, already flashed with firmware and connected, into back the jig as shown:

This makes an [assembled test jig]{output, qty: 1}.
