# Conductive Graphite (Carbon) Felt
The Fisher Scientifics carbon felt is commonly used in academic studies. There are other more affordable suppliers on AliExpress and specialty carbon product suppliers in various regions worldwide. The felt needs to be conductive, this technically means it has to have been "graphitized" and thermally treated at a sufficiently high temperature, though sometimes it may still be sold as "carbon felt" as in the Fisher Scientific product.
