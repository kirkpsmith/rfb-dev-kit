> **Caution** 
> 
> From this point onwards, chemical safety risks are present. **You** are responsible for your own safety! Use proper PPE and do not perform anything you are not comfortable with. These instructions are presented as-is with no guarantee of your safety or assumed liability. Work in a well-ventilated area, with someone else nearby aware that you are working with chemicals and able to assist or call for help if needed



### Tools 

* 1 [50 mL beaker]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [pair of chemical safety goggles]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [pair of nitrile gloves]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [scale]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [stir bar]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [stir plate]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [vial]{: Class="missing"}    - min. 20 mL
* 1 [weighing spatula]{: Class="missing"} 


### Chemicals 

* 10.0 grams of [8% vinegar/acetic acid]{: Class="missing"} 
* 3.0 grams of [potassium acetate]{: Class="missing"} 
* 6.6 grams of [potassium iodide]{: Class="missing"} 
* 2.8 grams of [zinc chloride]{: Class="missing"} 




## Step 1: Put on your personal protective equipment (PPE) {:id="put-on-your-personal-protective-equipment-ppe" class="page-step"}

Put on a [pair of chemical safety goggles]{: Class="missing"}, a [pair of nitrile gloves]{: Class="missing"}, wear close-toed shoes, and wear long pants/trousers! A lab coat is recommended.

## Step 2: Weigh out the chemicals {:id="weigh-out-the-chemicals" class="page-step"}


In a [50 mL beaker]{: Class="missing"}, using a [scale]{: Class="missing"} and [weighing spatula]{: Class="missing"}, weigh out the following chemicals according to their quantities listed above:

* [zinc chloride]{: Class="missing"}
* [potassium iodide]{: Class="missing"}
* [potassium acetate]{: Class="missing"}
* [8% vinegar/acetic acid]{: Class="missing"}

## Step 3: Mix the electrolyte {:id="mix-the-electrolyte" class="page-step"}

Add a [stir bar]{: Class="missing"} to the beaker and place it on a [stir plate]{: Class="missing"}. Mix at room temperature until all salts are dissolved.

## Step 4: Store the electrolyte in an air-tight container {:id="store-the-electrolyte-in-an-air-tight-container" class="page-step"}

> **Warning** 
> 
> Aqueous iodide is oxidized in solution by dissolved oxygen, turning the solution yellow/brown.

Transfer and store prepared electrolytes in a sealed [vial]{: Class="missing"} to minimize exposure to ambient air.
