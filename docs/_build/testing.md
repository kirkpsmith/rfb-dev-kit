### Parts 

* 2 [19/22 silicone septa]{: Class="bom"} 


### Tools 

* 1 [5 mL syringe]{: Class="missing"} 
* 1 [scale]{: Class="missing"} 




## Step 1: Weigh and add electrolyte to the cell {:id="weigh-and-add-electrolyte-to-the-cell" class="page-step"}

Using a [5 mL syringe]{: Class="missing"} and the [scale]{: Class="missing"}, add 5 mL of electrolyte to each reservoir, weighing the syringe before and after injection to record the actual mass added to each reservoir. 

## Step 2: Close the reservoirs {:id="close-the-reservoirs" class="page-step"}

Using 19/22 silicone [septa][19/22 silicone septa], close the reservoirs.

## Step 3: Pre-circulate the electrolyte {:id="pre-circulate-the-electrolyte" class="page-step"}

Turn the pumps on and circulate the electrolytes for 15 min before applying any current. 


> **Note** 
> 
> This should allow enough time for the separator to become fully wetted with electrolyte and clear out any bubbles trapped in the cell/felts.

## Step 4: Connect to the potentiostat and define cycling conditions {:id="connect-to-the-potentiostat-and-define-cycling-conditions" class="page-step"}

Typical conditions for current cell:

- Constant current charge at 30 mA/cmÂ² to fixed capacity (*e.g.* 25 Ah/L) with high voltage cutoff of 1.6V
- Constant current charge at same current density to 0 V
- Cycling nonstop to your heart's content, or something happens to end the test
