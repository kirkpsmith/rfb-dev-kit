# Assembling the flow cell from components

Ensure you have the following components:
{{BOM}}

## Attach the barbed fittings {pagestep}

Take the two [cell bodies](fromstep){qty: 2} and place one [o-ring][o-rings](orings.md){qty: 4} at the bottom of each threaded hole.

Then insert and carefully hand-thread the [barbed fittings](barbed_fittings.md){qty:4} to the bottom of the port.

## Insert the copper plates {pagestep}

Place the two [copper current collectors](fromstep){qty: 2} into the square machined recesses of the cell bodies. They should fit very snugly. **This aligmnent is crucial to prevent leaks.**

## Insert the four bolts into one cell body {pagestep}

Take one cell body and insert the four [M6 x 60 mm hex socket cap bolts]{qty: 4} so that the socket caps are on the same side of the cell as the barbs.

## Add the first grafoil current collector {pagestep}

Take this same cell body and place one [grafoil current collector][grafoil current collectors](fromstep){qty: 2} on top of the copper plate.

## Add the first pass-through gasket {pagestep}

Place one [pass-through gasket][pass-through gaskets](fromstep){qty: 2} on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the gasket and align it with the fluid holes in the cell body.

## Add the first flow frame {pagestep}

Place one [flow frame][flow frames](fromstep){qty: 2} on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the flow frame and align it with the fluid holes in the gasket.

## Add the first blocking gasket {pagestep}

Place one [blocking gasket][blocking gaskets](fromstep){qty: 2} on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the gasket and align it with the fluid holes in the flow frame.

## Add the membranes {pagestep}

Take the three [cut membranes](fromstep){qty: 3} and add them to the assembly.

## Add the second blocking gasket {pagestep}

Place one blocking gasket on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the gasket.

## Add the second flow frame {pagestep}

Place one flow frame on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the flow frame.

## Add the second pass-through gasket {pagestep}

Place one pass-through gasket on top of the assembly, using the bolts to guide the gasket and align it with the fluid holes in the flow frame.

## Add the second grafoil current collector {pagestep}

Place one grafoil current collector on top of the pass-through gasket, so that it will align with the copper current collector of the second cell body in the next step.

## Add the second cell body {pagestep}

Place the second cell body (with barbs and copper plate installed) on top of the assembly and ensure all fluid holes are aligned. Hand-tighten four [M6 nuts]{qty: 4} onto the exposed threads of the bolts in order to lightly compress the cell and hold all the components in place.

## Tighten the bolts {pagestep}

Progressively tighten the bolts to 5 Nâ‹…m in a [4-bolt flange pattern](https://www.flangeboltchart.com/torque-patterns/4-bolt-torque-pattern) using a [torque wrench]{qty: 1, cat: tool, Note: to accept 5 mm allen key or 10 mm hex socket} fitted with a [10 mm socket]{qty: 1, cat: tool, Note: To fit torque wrench} and a [5mm hex key]{qty: 1,cat: tool}

**Now you have an [assembled flow cell]{output, qty:1}!**
