# Tubing

This tubing seems to be made from a BPT-like exterior tubing with a PTFE-like liner which is good for flow battery chemical compatibility. It used to be called "Tygon Chemical" tubing and still is in some places.


>!! **Warning** 
>!!
>!! PTFE-lined tubing in the pump head is essential for electrolytes which contain iodide, as charged iodide species can destroy common pump head tubing materials like silicone and BPT
