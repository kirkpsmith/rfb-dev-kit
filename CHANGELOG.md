## [Unreleased]

### Added

- A jig to help assemble the cell

### Fixed

### Changed

- Cell design. Barbs now are printed onto the flow frame, and extend out through a FDM-printable endplate. The endplate can be printed in a rigid, yet non-chemically-compatible material (like PLA/PETG), while the flow path can be fully polypropylene. All flow cell components have changed.
- Pumps are now peristaltic, not diaphragm.
