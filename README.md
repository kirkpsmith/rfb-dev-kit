# RFB-dev-kit

![FreeCAD view of assembled cell](image.png)

A benchtop flow battery development kit, extendable to other electrochemical systems with flow.
Designed in FreeCAD 0.21.1 with the fasteners workbench.

Developed by the [Flow Battery Research Collective](https://opencollective.com/fbrc).

## Features
- Geometric cell area from 1 cm² to 10 cm²
- Flow-through electrodes as standard

## Design Choices
- Minimize machining of metal and graphitic materials
- Flow-through porous carbon electrodes of variable thickness
- Maximize off-the-shelf part availability
- Manufacturable by multiple methods, e.g. FDM/SLA/SLS printing, conventional subtractive machining, etc.

## TODO
- [ ] (as needed) add ridges in printed parts to enhance sealing
- [ ] mark a first release and implement a [changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
- [ ] add a contributors section from https://github.com/all-contributors/all-contributors
- [ ] get this thing a DOI with Zenodo or something
