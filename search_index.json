These documents assume the use of a MYSTAT potentiostat and it's modified control software.\nThe Arduino is connected to an L298N motor driver, which is powered by a 24 V DC power source. This is a simple dual H-bridge motor driver that allows the Arduino to control the speeds of the peristaltic pumps using pulse width modulation (PWM). There is no speed feedback; we only tell the motors which direction to turn and whether they run at 100% maximum speed, 0% speed (off), or anything in between. To know the speed (in rpm) or flowrate (in mL/min) of the peristaltic pumps, a separate measurement is required (like dispensing water into a graduated cylinder).\nWe use the open-source MYSTAT (with our own modifications to the control software), but any equivalent potentiostat or battery cycler will do. Our pump control system is based on the MYSTAT software, though, and can be used without the MYSTAT present.\nWith this hardware configuration, the MYSTAT software then allows for entire control of this electrochemical system: the applied currents and voltages as well as the speeds of the electrolyte pumps.\nStep 1: Flash firmware to microcontroller\nUsing the Arduino IDE with the elapsedMillis library installed, upload the following code to the Arduino. The location of the code in the repository is here\nStep 2: Remove on-board jumpers from motor driver\nRemove the three on-board jumpers (highlighted in pink) from the motor driver board:\n\nStep 3: Connect cables between Arduino, motor driver, and power supply\nConnect according to the below diagram, taking care to connect the negative terminal of the 24 V power supply lead to both the GND terminal of the motor driver (middle connection of the three-terminal screw connection header) and a GND pin of the Arduino, so that the Arduino's signals to the motor driver are in relation to the same fixed GND.\n\nThe wiring should look like this when you're done (feel free to make it tidier!)\n\nThis makes the <a name=\"output__motor-control-electronics\"></a>motor control electronics\nConnect microcontroller to PC\nTODO", "breadcrumbs": ["electronics.md"]}, {"path": "cell_assembly", "title": "Assembling the flow cell from components", "content": "<!-- There should be only one Header per page.
