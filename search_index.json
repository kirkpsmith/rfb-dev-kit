To know the flowrate (in mL/min) of the peristaltic pumps, a separate measurement is required (like dispensing water into a graduated cylinder).\nWe use the open-source MYSTAT (with our own modifications to the control software), but any equivalent potentiostat or battery cycler will do. Our pump control system is based on the MYSTAT software, though, and can be used without the MYSTAT present.\nWith this hardware configuration, the MYSTAT software then allows for entire control of this electrochemical system: the applied currents and voltages as well as the speeds of the electrolyte pumps. \nStep 1: Flash firmware to microcontroller\nUsing the Arduino IDE with the elapsedMillis library installed, upload the following code to the Arduino.
